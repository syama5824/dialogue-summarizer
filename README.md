# Dialog Summarization with Generative AI

This project focuses on summarizing human dialogues using generative AI techniques. The objective is to convert long, often unstructured conversations into concise, meaningful summaries while preserving the core context and intent.

## Features

- Summarizes multi-turn dialogues using advanced language models
- Handles informal, noisy, or multi-speaker conversation data
- Supports extractive and abstractive summarization approaches
- Easy integration with Hugging Face models like `T5`, `BART`, or `DialoGPT`
- CLI and notebook-based inference support
